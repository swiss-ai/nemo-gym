"""Turn a rollout's captured token records into trainable trajectories.

The builder is a pure function over a list of ``TokenEntry`` records (whatever a
``TokenSource`` returns). It has two strategies:

  per_request     assumes nothing about how the calls relate; every call becomes
                  its own training sequence. Always valid.
  prefix_merging  chains calls by the token-prefix relationship: each call is
                  parented to the earlier call whose full token sequence (prompt
                  plus generation) is the longest prefix of this call's prompt.
                  This rebuilds a multi-turn, append-only rollout into one chain.
                  A prompt that no longer extends any earlier call starts a new
                  root (a compacted or rewritten context). Two candidate parents
                  with identical sequences are ambiguous, so that subtree is
                  quarantined rather than guessed.

Both are order-independent: they do not depend on arrival order or any sequence
number. ``prefix_merging`` processes entries by increasing prompt length, which
is derived from the tokens themselves (a parent's prompt is shorter than its
child's), so concurrent or out-of-order capture yields the same result.

Loss masks follow provenance: tokens the policy generated are marked 1 (with
their captured log probabilities), and everything re-fed into a prompt (history,
tool output, tokens added between calls) is marked 0.
