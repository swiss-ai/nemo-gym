"""Turning one finished rollout record into a token-bearing one.

This is the step between capture and training: the rollout has run, its model
calls were recorded somewhere, and the record needs its ``response.output``
replaced with the merged trajectory before anything reads it.

It takes the record and a ``TokenSource``, and nothing else. Both belong to the
caller. Every configuration question, whether capture is on, where records were
written, which agents emit the correlation prefix, is answered on whichever side
owns that configuration and never read across the boundary: Gym's rollout
collection resolves its source from Gym's config, and a training framework
staging records through its own data plane passes its own source and never
touches Gym's config at all.

What a rollout needs is read from the rollout. An item that already carries
token ids holds what the policy sampled, so that rollout is left alone; an item
without them needs the recorded ids attached. That works for a batch mixing
native agents and external harnesses, and keeps working as native agents move
onto capture: such an agent simply stops arriving with ids and starts being
rebuilt, with no change here.
