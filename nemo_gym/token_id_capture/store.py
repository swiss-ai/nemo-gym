"""Append-only, rollout-keyed store for training ``TokenEntry`` records.

One file per rollout (``<rollout_id>.tokens.jsonl``), separate from the
evaluation capture file (``<rollout_id>.capture.jsonl``) so token payloads never
bloat eval reads. Each write fsyncs and holds a per-file ``flock`` (which
excludes other threads and worker processes writing the *same* rollout file),
because a killed box must not lose a rollout's training tokens.

Concurrency is per file, not global: there is deliberately no process-wide lock.
Every model call appends to its own rollout's file, so a global lock would
serialize all of them behind one fsync. On a shared or network filesystem that
collapses throughput to ~1/fsync-latency regardless of core count. The per-file
flock keeps concurrent writers to one rollout correct while letting writes to
different rollouts proceed in parallel.
