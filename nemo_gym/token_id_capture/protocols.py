"""Interfaces for writing and reading captured training tokens.

Gym owns the record shape, these protocols, and the code that builds a record. A
training framework supplies the implementations and runs them wherever its
tokens are produced. Neither side imports the other's transport.

Placement of the write is therefore a deployment choice:

- Gym owns serving (today): install the sink in the model server, which already
  holds the assembled response, so there is no extra hop.
- A framework owns the inference worker: install the sink there, so bulk token
  arrays go to the framework's data plane instead of riding back through Gym's
  HTTP response.

The capture code is the same in both cases. This module must stay free of
fastapi, ray, torch and aiohttp imports so a framework's worker can import it
without pulling in Gym's server stack. A unit test enforces that.
